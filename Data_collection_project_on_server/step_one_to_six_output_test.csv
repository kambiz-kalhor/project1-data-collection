A strictly anaerobic, mesophilic, syntrophic, alkane-degrading strain, L81T, was isolated from a biofilm sampled from a black smoker chimney at the Lokis Castle vent field. Cells were straight, rod-shaped, Gram-positive-staining and motile. Growth was observed at pH6.2-9.5, 14-42°C and 0.5-6% (ww) NaCl, with optima at pH7.0-8.2, 37°C and 3% (ww) NaCl. Proteinaceous substrates, sugars, organic acids and hydrocarbons were utilized for growth. Thiosulfate was used as an external electron acceptor during growth on crude oil. Strain L81T was capable of syntrophic hydrocarbon degradation when co-cultured with a methanogenic archaeon, designated strain LG6, isolated from the same enrichment. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that strain L81T is affiliated with the family Lachnospiraceae, and is most closely related to the type strains of Natranaerovirga pectinivora (92% sequence similarity) and Natranaerovirga hydrolytica (90%). The major cellular fatty acids of strain L81T were C15:0, anteiso-C15:0 and C16:0, and the profile was distinct from those of the species of the genus Natranaerovirga. The polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, three unidentified phospholipids, four unidentified glycolipids and two unidentified phosphoglycolipids. The GC content of genomic DNA was determined to be 31.7mol%. Based on our phenotypic, phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic results, strain L81T is considered to represent a novel species of a new genus of the family Lachnospiraceae, for which we propose the name Abyssivirga alkaniphila gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of Abyssivirga alkaniphila is L81T (DSM 29592TJCM 30920T).

Cells were Gram-stain-positive, straight rods (0.7-0.83.0-5.0m) and motile by means of lateral flagella. Strain ST07-YET was mesophilic (optimum 35°C), moderately alkaliphilic and halotolerant (optimum pH8.7 and 5g l-1 NaCl).

Yeast extract, peptone, tryptone, Casamino acids, crotonate, pyruvate, galactose, maltose, sucrose, ribose, trehalose and glucose were used as carbon sources. Glucose fermentation led to acetate, H2 and CO2 formation. Arginine, serine, histidine, lysine, methionine and cysteine improved growth, but the Stickland reaction was negative for the combinations of amino acids tested. The major metabolic products from yeast extract fermentation were H2, CO2, acetate, butyrate, isobutyrate, isovalerate and propionate.

Cells were Gram-stain-negative, catalase-negative, non-spore-forming, non-motile rods measuring 0.7-1.0 m in width and 3.0-8.0 m in length. The optimum temperature for growth of strain RL-C(T) was 37 °C (range 25-40 °C) and pH 7.0-7.5 (range pH 5.7-8.0). The strain could grow fermentatively on yeast extract, tryptone, arabinose, glucose, galactose, mannose, maltose, lactose, glycogen, pectin and starch. The main end products of glucose fermentation were acetate, H2 and CO2. Organic acids, alcohols and amino acids were not utilized for growth. Yeast extract was not required for growth; however, it stimulated growth slightly. Nitrate, sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate, elemental sulfur and Fe(III) nitrilotriacetate were not reduced as terminal electron acceptors. Aesculin was hydrolysed but not gelatin. Indole and H2S were produced from yeast extract. The GC content of the genomic DNA was 51.2 mol%. The major cellular fatty acids were iso-C15:0, anteiso-C15:0 and C16:0. The most abundant polar lipid of strain RL-C(T) was phosphatidylethanolamine. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the isolate belongs to the uncultured Blvii28 wastewater-sludge group (http:www.arb-silva.de) in the family Rikenellaceae of the phylum Bacteroidetes, and shared low sequence similarities with the related species Alistipes shahii WAL 8301(T) (81.8%), Rikenella microfusus ATCC 29728(T) (81.7%) and Anaerocella delicata WN081(T) (80.9%).

A novel, extremely thermoacidophilic, obligately chemolithotrophic archaeon (strain JP7(T)) was isolated from a solfatara on Lihir Island, Papua New Guinea. Cells of this organism were non-motile, Gram-negative staining, irregular-shaped cocci, 0.5-1.5 microm in size, that grew aerobically by oxidation of sulfur, Fe(2) or mineral sulfides. Cells grew anaerobically using Fe(3) as a terminal electron acceptor and H(2)S as an electron donor but did not oxidize hydrogen with elemental sulfur as electron acceptor. Strain JP7(T) grew optimally at 74 degrees C (temperature range 45-83 degrees C) and pH 0.8-1.4 (pH range 0.35-3.0). On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, strain JP7(T) was shown to belong to the Sulfolobaceae, being most closely related to the type strains of Acidianus ambivalens (93.7 %) and Acidianus infernus (93.6 %). Cell-membrane lipid structure, DNA base composition and 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity data support the placement of this strain in the genus Acidianus. Differences in aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, temperature and pH range for growth, and 16S rRNA gene sequence differentiate strain JP7(T) from recognized species of the genus Acidianus, and an emendation of the description of the genus is proposed. Strain JP7(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Acidianus, for which the name Acidianus sulfidivorans sp. nov. is proposed.

An acidophilic gammaproteobacterium, isolated from a pit lake at an abandoned metal mine in south-west Spain, was shown to be distantly related to all characterized prokaryotes, and to be the first representative of a novel genus and species. Isolate MCF85 is a Gram-negative, non-motile, rod-shaped mesophilic bacterium with a temperature growth optimum of 32-35 °C (range 8-45 °C). It was categorized as a moderate acidophile, growing optimally at pH 3.5-4.0 and between pH 2.5 and 4.5. Under optimum conditions its culture doubling time was around 75 min. Only organic electron donors were used by MCF85, and the isolate was confirmed to be an obligate heterotroph. It grew on a limited range of sugars (hexoses and disaccharides, though not pentoses) and some other small molecular weight organic compounds, and growth was partially or completely inhibited by small concentrations of some aliphatic acids. The acidophile grew in the presence of 100 mM ferrous iron or aluminium, but was more sensitive to some other metals, such as copper. It was also much more tolerant of arsenic (V) than arsenic (III). Isolate MCF85 catalysed the reductive dissolution of the ferric iron mineral schwertmannite when incubated under micro-aerobic or anaerobic conditions, causing the culture media pH to increase. There was no evidence, however, that the acidophile could grow by ferric iron respiration under strictly anoxic conditions.

Two strains of subdivision 1 Acidobacteria, a pink-pigmented bacterium KA1(T) and a colourless isolate WH120(T), were obtained from acidic Sphagnum peat and wood under decay by the white-rot fungus Hyploma fasciculare, respectively. Cells of these isolates were Gram-negative-staining, non-motile, short rods, which were covered by large polysaccharide capsules and occurred singly, in pairs, or in short chains. Strains KA1(T) and WH120(T) were strictly aerobic mesophiles that grew between 10 and 33 °C, with an optimum at 22-28 °C. Both isolates developed under acidic conditions, but strain WH120(T) was more acidophilic (pH growth range 3.5-6.4; optimum, 4.0-4.5) than strain KA1(T) (pH growth range 3.5-7.3; optimum , 5.0-5.5). The preferred growth substrates were sugars. In addition, the wood-derived isolate WH120(T) grew on oxalate, lactate and xylan, while the peat-inhabiting acidobacterium strain KA1(T) utilized galacturonate, glucuronate and pectin. The major fatty acids were iso-C(15:0) and iso-C(17:1)8c; the cells also contained significant amounts of 13,16-dimethyl octacosanedioic acid. The quinone was MK-8. The DNA GC contents of strains KA1(T) and WH120(T) were 54.1 and 51.7 mol%, respectively. Strains KA1(T) and WH120(T) displayed 97.8% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to each other. The closest recognized relatives were Acidobacterium capsulatum and Telmatobacter bradus (93.4-94.3% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). These species differed from strains KA1(T) and WH120(T) by their ability to grow under anoxic conditions, the absence of capsules, presence of cell motility and differing fatty acid composition.

New thermoacidophilic organisms that were able to grow anaerobically on starch were isolated from the acidic hot springs of Kamchatka. Strain 1904T, isolated from a hot spring of the Moutnovski volcano, was characterized in detail. Its cells were regular or irregular cocci that were 1-2 microm in diameter, non-motile, and had a cell envelope consisting of one layer of subunits. The new organism was a hyperthermophile, growing in the temperature range 60-92 degrees C (with an optimum at 85 degrees C), an acidophile, having the pH range for growth of 2.0-6.0 (with an optimum at 3.8), and an obligate anaerobe. It fermented starch, forming acetate as the main growth product. Other growth substrates were yeast extract, beef extract and soya extract. Growth on yeast extract, beef extract and soya extract was stimulated by elemental sulfur, which was reduced to H2S. Acetate, arabinose, cellulose, formate, fructose, galactose, glucose, glycine, guar gum, lichenan, malate, maltose, methanol, pectin, pyruvate, propionate, xylan, xylose or a mixture of amino acids failed to support growth both in the presence and the absence of sulfur.

An anaerobic acidophilic, hyperthermophilic archaeon, designated strain 345-15(T), was isolated from an acidic hot spring of Kamchatka (Russia). Cells of strain 345-15(T) were regular or irregular cocci, 1-2 mum in diameter, with flagella. Strain 345-15(T) grew optimally at 80-85 degrees C and pH 3.5-4.0 and fermented a wide range of carbohydrates, including polysaccharides. Acetate, ethanol and lactate were the fermentation products. Growth was stimulated by elemental sulfur and thiosulfate, which were reduced to hydrogen sulfide. The GC content of the DNA was 54.5 mol%. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that strain 345-15(T) belonged to the genus Acidilobus. The level of DNA-DNA hybridization between strain 345-15(T) and Acidilobus aceticus 1904(T) was 61 %. Thus, strain 345-15(T) was considered as representing a novel species of the genus Acidilobus, with the name Acidilobus saccharovorans sp. nov.

The molar GC content in the DNA was 36 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis demonstrated that strain V(T) was a member of the family Ferroplasmaceae, order Thermoplasmatales, phylum Euryarchaeota, showing sequence identities of 100 % with Ferroplasma cupricumulans BH2(T), 95.4 % with Ferroplasma acidiphilum Y(T), 94 % with Picrophilus torridus DSM 9790(T) and 92 % with Picrophilus oshimae DSM 9789(T). 16S rRNA gene sequence-based phylogenetic analysis showed that strain V(T) formed a monophyletic cluster together with F. cupricumulans BH2(T) and all other thermophilic isolates with available 16S rRNA gene sequences, whereas F. acidiphilum Y(T) formed another cluster with mesophilic isolates within the family Ferroplasmaceae. DNA-DNA hybridization values between strain V(T) and F. cupricumulans BH2(T) were well below 70 %, indicating that the two strains belong to separate species. Principal membrane lipids of strain V(T) were dibiphytanyl-based tetraether lipids containing pentacyclic rings. The polar lipids were dominated by a single phosphoglycolipid derivative based on a galactosyl dibiphytanyl phosphoglycerol tetraether, together with smaller amounts of monoglycosyl and diglycosyl dibiphytanyl ether lipids and the corresponding phosphoglycerol derivatives. The major respiratory quinones present were naphthoquinone derivatives. Given the notable physiological and chemical differences as well as the distinct phylogenetic placement of the new isolate relative to the type species of the genus Ferroplasma, we propose strain V(T) as a member of a new genus and species, Acidiplasma aeolicum gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of Acidiplasma aeolicum is strain V(T) (DSM 18409(T) JCM 14615(T)).

The characteristics of the four isolates were almost identical. The isolates were strictly aerobic and chemo-organotrophic. They were gram-negative, non-motile cocci and coccobacilli, formed salmon-pink colonies on solidified media and produced BChl a and carotenoids only under aerobic growth conditions. The cells also produced small amounts of zinc-substituted BChl a when grown in the presence of 1 mM zinc sulfate. Anaerobic growth in the light was not found, but aerobic growth was stimulated by continuous incandescent illumination. The isolates grew in a pH range of 3.5-6.0, with pH optima of 4.5-5.0. A phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rDNA sequences showed that the isolates clustered in the major acidophilic group of the class Proteobacteria, which includes species of the genera Acidiphilium and Rhodopila.

Previous work, based on multi-locus sequence analysis, identified a fourth group of iron- and sulfur-oxidizing acidithiobacilli as a potential distinct species. Eleven strains of Group IV acidithiobacilli, isolated from different global locations, have been studied. These were all shown to be obligate chemolithotrophs, growing aerobically by coupling the oxidation of ferrous iron or reduced sulfur (but not hydrogen) to molecular oxygen, or anaerobically by the oxidation of reduced sulfur coupled to ferric iron reduction. All strains were mesophilic, although some were also psychrotolerant. Strain variation was also noted in terms of tolerance to extremely low pH and to elevated concentrations of transition metals. One strain was noted to display far greater tolerance to chloride than reported for other iron-oxidizing acidithiobacilli. All of the strains were able to catalyse the oxidative dissolution of pyrite and, on the basis of some of the combined traits of some of the strains examined, it is proposed that these may have niche roles in commercial mineral bioprocessing operations, such as for low temperature bioleaching of polysulfide ores in brackish waters.

A novel member of Acidobacteria was isolated from a microbial mat growing on a geothermally heated dead tree trunk in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park (HI, USA). The rod-shaped, Gram-negative capsulated cells of strain PMMR2T were non-motile and catalase and oxidase negative. Growth occurred aerobically from 15 to 55°C (optimum, 40°C) and at pH values from 4.5 to 7.0 (optimum, 6.5). A limited range of sugars and organic acids supported growth. However, results of a genomic analysis suggested that various polysaccharides might be hydrolysed as carbon sources, and evidence for pectin degradation was observed in liquid cultures. A genomic analysis also revealed genes for a Group 1f uptake hydrogenase; assays with liquid cultures confirmed hydrogen consumption, including uptake at sub-atmospheric concentrations. Nitrate was not dissimilated to nitrite. Major membrane fatty acids included iso-C15:0 and iso-C17:0. The GC content was 57.2mol%. A comparative genome analysis revealed an average nucleotide identity of 72.2% between PMMR2T and its nearest cultured phylogenetic neighbour, Acidobacterium capsulatum ATCC 51196T (JCM 7670T); analysis of the 16S rRNA gene revealed a 96.8% sequence identity with Acidobacterium capsulatum ATCC 51196T. These results and other phenotypic differences indicated that strain PMMR2T represents a novel species in the genus Acidobacterium, for which the name Acidobacterium ailaaui sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain, PMMR2T (DSM 27394TLMG 28340T), is the second formal addition to the genus Acidobacterium.","Growth occurred aerobically from 15 to 55°C (optimum, 40°C) and at pH values from 4.5 to 7.0 (optimum, 6.5)","[[('', '', '', '', '', '', '', '4.5', '7.0', 'optimum', '6.5', '')]]",,[]
